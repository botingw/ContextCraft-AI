# ContextCraft-AI 🧠 — Memory-Centric Rules for Reliable AI Coding

**Give your AI coding assistants real project memory.** ContextCraft-AI weaves a structured “Memory Bank” with platform-specific rules so Cursor, CLINE, RooCode & Windsurf answer consistently—even on complex, multi-repo codebases.

## 🌟 Key Features

| Feature | Why it matters |
|---------|---------------|
| **Memory-first design** | Docs/ & tasks/ folders captured as long-term context. |
| **Universal rulebook** | Same Plan • Implement • Debug flows on every IDE. |
| **Portable & lean** | Loads only the rules each assistant needs → fewer tokens. |
| **Quick migration** | One-command installer copies templates into any repo. |
